📄 README: Image Resizer Tool

📝 Description


This Python-based tool allows you to resize and convert images in bulk from a source folder and save them into a separate folder. It is useful for:

1)Web optimization

2)Machine learning preprocessing

3)Thumbnail creation

4)Standardizing image dimensions for apps, social media, or CMS platforms

The tool utilizes the Pillow (PIL) library to handle image processing and the built-in os module to automate file handling and folder traversal.

🔧 Features

1)Resize all images in a specified folder to a fixed size (e.g., 256×256).

2)Supports common image formats like .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .bmp, .gif.

3)Automatically creates the output folder if it doesn't exist.

4)Skips non-image files.

5)Handles errors gracefully with useful console messages.



🛠️ Tools Used:

1)Python 3.x

2)Pillow (pip install pillow)

3)os module (built-in)
